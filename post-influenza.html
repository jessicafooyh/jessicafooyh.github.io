                    <p>I've always been curious as to how brands choose which influencers to market their products. I suspect most brands look at the number of followers an influencer has, and if the brand is more discerning, possibly the ratio of average 'like's to the number of followers. More importantly though, what exactly is a brand's strategy? <strong>Should a brand try to get as many "impressions" as possible and cast the widest net, or should a brand focus on capturing share from a concentrated bunch who are likely to follow the same influencers based on their preferences?</strong> Both strategies have their merits and are likely applicable depending on the product they're selling. If we can map a network of influencers, with links determined by their shared followers (i.e., influencer A is connected to influencer B if follower 1 follows both of them), then we can gain clarity on how to choose influencers to market products.</p>
                    <p>To begin, I had to scrape influencers' followers from Instagram. This turned out to be much trickier than I'd imagined. The first major problem was that it was not possible to scroll through an influencers' entire list of followers - at some point, the Javascript froze. To circumvent this problem, I resorted to scraping the <strong>unique set of followers who'd liked each influencer's latest 12 photos</strong>, resulting in a set of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">active</span> followers. Admittedly, the biggest problem with this is that the average human being is less likely to 'like' an influencer's photo than a personal friend's photo. However, if we assume that influencers' followers have the same propensity (to not like an influencer's photo) on average across all influencers, then the data is still valid. The second problem is that the 12 photos scraped may not fully capture each influencer's active followers. Ideally, I'd liked to scrape all the photos, but this project is simply exploratory, and I think 12 photos is sufficient to be representative - I'm not sure what posting activity should be like for an influencer, but I'd assume that an influencer should have to produce good/representative content at least once in every 12 photos (I also manually checked this, ensuring that I'd scraped at least one photo that hit the average 'likes' an influencer gets). Still, this whole process took a very long time, 1-2 weeks to be exact (in June 2018). I had to space out the automatic scrolling function to avoid crashing the Javascript (I think Instagram does this intentionally, and with good reason), and also used multiprocessing on Python to max out the number of cores crawling. If you have any suggestions on how to improve my scraping code (on <a href="https://github.com/jessicafooyh/Influenza">Github</a>), please holler!</p>
                    <p>To visualise the network, I first constructed an symmetric co-occurrence matrix from the set of followers each influencer has, which represented the number of times influencers' followers 'co-occured' i.e., followed both. While the number of followers one has is important to determine how influential someone is, this project tries to understand a different part of the puzzle (i.e., the relationships between influencers), so I didn't want the model to be affected by the number of followers. Therefore, I chose to then create a adjacency matrix based on Jaccard similarity (i.e., the intersection of followers divided by the union). Once I had an adjacency matrix, I could then build a network graph. I also used the <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1112/1112.4134.pdf">Louvain</a> method to detect 'communities' among influencers.</p>
