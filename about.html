          <p>Hello! I'm currently adulting in Singapore, bidding my time in a 9-5 job.</p>
            <p>Some background on my education - I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, with a B.A. in Economics, and a minor in Mathematics. I loved my time in Philly, and those were undoubtedly some of my best years. I had the opportunity to learn a wide variety of subjects, which has fundamentally changed my perspectives on many things in life. Some of my favourite classes were <strong>ECON 221 (Time Series Econometrics: Forecasting)</strong>, taught by Professor Diebold, who single-handedly gave me the confidence to do Math and taught me to appreciate college-level Econ; <strong>ASTR 001 (A Survey of the Universe)</strong>, taught by Professor Devlin, who opened my eyes to a reality far beyond what I could see and helped me appreciate my insignificance in this world; <strong>HIST 416 (18th Century Intellectual History)</strong>, taught by Professor Kors, who led me to question the way knowledge is acquired and remembered; and <strong>STAT 476 (Applied Probability Models in Marketing)</strong>, taught by Professor Fader, who helped me overcome my fears of probability distribution functions and Bayes' posterior means.</p>
            <p>After fiddling with applied statistics in undergrad, I enrolled in a M.Sc. in Statistics program at the University of Chicago to expose myself to the theoretical rigour of what I'd learned at Penn. I was pushed to my limit, suddenly thrown into the world of "subspaces", "second order"s and "likelihoods" - basically a lot of math and proofs. I'm glad I survived and on hindsight, I'm grateful that I learned to learn. My favourite classes there were <strong>STAT 37400 (Nonparametric Inference)</strong>, taught by Professor Lafferty, and <strong>TTIC 31170 (Planning, Learning, and Estimation for Robotics and AI)</strong>, taught by Professor Walter.</p>
            <p>My professional experience includes a marketing internship at <strong>PlayMoolah</strong>, where I was first exposed to Singapore's startup scene, and had the opportunity to witness first-hand the way founders Audrey and Min combined heart and passion with business acumen to introduce financial literacy to kids. In college, I had a brief stint at the <strong>Wharton Social Impact Initiative</strong>, where I tried my hand at consulting, and realised it wasn't my cup of tea. I also had the privilege to immerse myself in the open and honest learning culture at <strong>AQR Capital Management</strong>, surrounded by very intelligent people who enjoyed sharing ideas, challenging one another, and improving each other's work. Now, I work mostly on data analytics projects in the <strong>Economist Service</strong>.</p>
            <p>This site is born mostly out of nostalgia for the academic rigour of my college years. I'm hoping to somewhat save and remember what I'd done, and also hold myself accountable to do more during my free time out of work. No doubt 80% of my weekend will still be spent in bed, but perhaps, this site will motivate me to spend the remaining 20% on something productive. If you have any interesting ideas or hypotheses you'd like to explore with data, hit me up! :)</p>
